# SupaApp Step 3: Verification Guide

🎯 **You're on Step 3!** Your database is set up and Edge Function is deployed. Now let's verify everything is working correctly.

---

## 🧪 Test 1: Check App Status

### What to Look For
1. **Refresh your SupaApp** in the browser
2. **Look at the status indicator** in the top user info bar
3. **Check the connection banner**

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- **Status shows "Live"** with a green dot (not "Demo" or "Connecting")
- **No demo mode banner** at the top
- **User info bar shows** "Welcome back, [Your Name]!" with green "Live" status

### ❌ If You See:
- **"Demo" status**: Your Edge Function isn't responding - check deployment
- **"Connecting" status**: The health check is failing - check environment variables
- **Demo banner**: App thinks you're in demo mode - check Supabase config

---

## 🧪 Test 2: Direct Health Check

### Test the Edge Function Directly
Open this URL in a **new browser tab**:
```
https://mfnwotokumvnszljeuom.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-0e8b25fb/health
```

### ✅ Expected Result:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-22T...",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "service": "SupaApp Backend",
  "message": "SupaApp backend is running smoothly",
  "storage": "Storage buckets initialized"
}
```

### ❌ Common Issues:
- **404 Error**: Function not deployed or wrong name
- **500 Error**: Environment variables not set
- **CORS Error**: Function deployment issue
- **Timeout**: Function not responding

---

## 🧪 Test 3: User Registration

### Test Real User Creation
1. **Sign out** of your current account (click "Sign Out" in top right)
2. **Create a new account** with a different email
3. **Fill out the registration form**
4. **Check if registration succeeds**

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- **Account created successfully** (no error messages)
- **Automatically logged in** to the new account
- **Onboarding screen appears** for new users
- **User info shows** in the top bar

### ❌ If It Fails:
- **"Failed to create account"**: Check Edge Function logs
- **Network errors**: Health check probably failing
- **Stuck on loading**: Backend not responding

---

## 🧪 Test 4: Real-Time Features

### Test Chat Functionality
1. **Go to the Chats tab** (bottom navigation)
2. **Click on any demo user** to start a conversation
3. **Send a test message**
4. **Check if message appears**

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- **Messages send successfully** (no error in console)
- **Real-time updates** work
- **Message history** loads correctly

### Test Communities
1. **Go to Communities tab**
2. **Try creating a new community**
3. **Check if it appears in the list**

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- **Community creation** works
- **Data persists** between page refreshes
- **Real user data** (not just demo content)

---

## 🧪 Test 5: Data Persistence

### Test Data Storage
1. **Create some content** (community, message, etc.)
2. **Refresh the page** completely (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. **Check if data is still there**

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- **Data persists** after page refresh
- **User stays logged in** (doesn't go back to login screen)
- **Content loads** from real database

---

## 🛠️ Quick Troubleshooting

### If Health Check Fails (404/500 Error)

#### Check 1: Function Deployment
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **Edge Functions**
2. Look for function: `make-server-0e8b25fb`
3. Status should show **"Active"** or **"Deployed"**

#### Check 2: Environment Variables
1. Click on your function → **Settings**
2. Check **Environment Variables**
3. Should have: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = [your service role key]

#### Check 3: Function Logs
1. In Edge Functions, click on your function
2. Go to **Logs** tab
3. Look for error messages

### If App Shows "Demo Mode"

#### Check 1: Supabase Config
1. **Refresh the page** (F5)
2. Wait 10-15 seconds for health check
3. If still demo, check health endpoint manually

#### Check 2: Network Issues
1. **Open browser developer tools** (F12)
2. Go to **Console** tab
3. Look for network errors or CORS issues
4. Refresh page and watch for errors

### If Registration Fails

#### Check 1: Database Connection
Run this in **SQL Editor**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kv_store_0e8b25fb;
```
Should return a number (not an error).

#### Check 2: Function Logs
1. Try to register a user
2. Check **Edge Function logs** immediately
3. Look for specific error messages
