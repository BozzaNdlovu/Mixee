# SupaApp Deployment Checklist

## 🎯 Before You Start
- [ ] You have access to your Supabase project: `mfnwotokumvnszljeuom`
- [ ] You're logged into the Supabase Dashboard
- [ ] You have your service role key ready (Settings → API)

---

## 📋 Step 1: Database Setup (SQL Editor)

### Go to SQL Editor
- [ ] Navigate to **SQL Editor** in left sidebar
- [ ] Click **"New Query"**

### Run the SQL Script (Updated - Handles Existing Policies!)
- [ ] Copy **ALL** content from `/sql/setup-database.sql` (~300+ lines)
- [ ] Paste into SQL Editor (should start with `-- SupaApp Database Setup`)
- [ ] Click **"Run"** button
- [ ] **Ignore "policy already exists" errors** - this is normal!
- [ ] Wait for final success message: 
  ```
  🎉 SupaApp database setup completed successfully!
  ✅ Table: kv_store_0e8b25fb created
  ✅ Policies: 3 security policies active
  ```

### What to Expect
- [ ] ✅ **Green success messages** at the end
- [ ] ⚠️ **Yellow warnings about existing policies** - this is fine!
- [ ] ❌ **Red errors** - only worry about these if no success message appears
- [ ] 📊 **Final summary** with record counts and next steps

---

## ⚡ Step 2: Edge Function Deployment

### Go to Edge Functions
- [ ] Navigate to **Edge Functions** in left sidebar  
- [ ] Click **"Create Function"**
- [ ] Function name: `make-server-0e8b25fb` (exact spelling!)

### Deploy the Function
- [ ] Copy **ALL** content from `/supabase/functions/server/index.tsx`
- [ ] Paste into Edge Function editor (should start with `import { serve }`)
- [ ] Click **"Deploy"** button
- [ ] Wait for deployment to complete (green checkmark)
- [ ] Function should show as "Active" or "Deployed"

### Set Environment Variable (CRITICAL!)
- [ ] In Edge Functions, click on your deployed function
- [ ] Go to **Settings** tab or **Environment Variables**
- [ ] Add new variable:
  - **Key**: `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - **Value**: [Your service role key from Settings → API]
- [ ] Click **Save**
- [ ] **Redeploy function** if required after setting variables

---

## ✅ Step 3: Verification Tests

### Test 1: Database Verification
Run this in **SQL Editor**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM kv_store_0e8b25fb;
```
- [ ] Returns a number (should be 8+ demo records)
- [ ] No error messages about missing table

### Test 2: Policy Verification  
Run this in **SQL Editor**:
```sql
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'kv_store_0e8b25fb';
```
- [ ] Shows 3 policy names
- [ ] Policies exist and are active

### Test 3: Edge Function Health Check
Visit this URL in your browser:
```
https://mfnwotokumvnszljeuom.supabase.co/functions/v1/make-server-0e8b25fb/health
```
- [ ] Returns JSON with `"status": "healthy"`
- [ ] No "Function not found" error
- [ ] No "Internal server error"
- [ ] Response appears within 5-10 seconds

### Test 4: App Connection Test
- [ ] Refresh your SupaApp in the browser
- [ ] Should show **"Live"** mode (not "Demo")
- [ ] Banner should say "Connected to your Supabase project"
- [ ] Status indicator should be green
- [ ] Can access all features without "demo" warnings

## 🚨 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### ❌ "policy already exists" Error
- [ ] **✅ This is normal!** - The script handles this automatically
- [ ] Continue running the script to completion
- [ ] Look for the final success message
- [ ] Policies will be updated to the latest version

### ❌ "syntax error at or near 'import'"
- [ ] **Wrong editor!** - You put JavaScript code in SQL Editor
- [ ] SQL code goes in **SQL Editor**
- [ ] JavaScript code goes in **Edge Functions**

### ❌ Edge Function returns 404
- [ ] Function name must be exactly: `make-server-0e8b25fb`
- [ ] Deploy in **Edge Functions** section (not SQL Editor)
- [ ] Wait 1-2 minutes after deployment

### ❌ Edge Function returns 500
- [ ] Check **Edge Function logs** for specific errors
- [ ] Verify `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set correctly
- [ ] Make sure database setup completed successfully

### ❌ App still shows "Demo Mode"
- [ ] Both database **AND** Edge Function must work
- [ ] Test health endpoint first - must return "healthy"
- [ ] Check browser console for error messages
